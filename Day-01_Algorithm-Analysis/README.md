# Day 01 – Algorithm Analysis

## Topics Covered
- Analysis of Algorithm  
- Asymptotic Analysis  
- Order of Growth  
- Best Case, Worst Case, Average Case  

## Analysis of Algorithm
Algorithm analysis helps us understand how efficient an algorithm is in terms of time and space before implementing it.

To understand this concept better, I used the example of finding the **sum of N natural numbers**. 
Using this example, I learned:
- How to think step by step before writing code  
- How to analyze the logic instead of directly jumping to implementation  
- How different approaches affect time complexity  

This helped me improve my logical thinking and understand how algorithms are evaluated.

## Asymptotic Analysis
Asymptotic analysis studies the performance of an algorithm as the input size increases.  
It focuses on growth rate and ignores constants and lower-order terms.

- The idea is to measure order of Growth.
- It does not depend upon machine , Programming langauges , etc.
- No need to implement , we can analyze algorithm.

## Order of Growth
Order of growth tells how the running time or space requirement of an algorithm increases with input size.

Common examples:
- O(1)  
- O(log n)  
- O(n)  
- O(n²)  

## Case Analysis
- **Best Case:** Minimum time taken by an algorithm  
- **Worst Case:** Maximum time taken by an algorithm  
- **Average Case:** Expected time taken for a random input
